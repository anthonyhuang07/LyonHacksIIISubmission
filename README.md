## What is a Pomodoro timer?

A Pomodoro timer is a productivity timer method that works by starting with a Pomodoro timer, by default it's at 25 minutes. When the time is up , it goes on to a 5 minute break. Once time is up, the cycle repeats until the 4th Pomodoro. When the 4th Pomodoro is up, the long break comes up, usually 15 minutes long.
